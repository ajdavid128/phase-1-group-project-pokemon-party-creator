## Project Details
This single-page web application was designed by Aaron David, Nick Phelps and Jonny Tilahun for their Phase 1 group project at Flatiron School during the 10-10-22 East Cohort.

The focus of this project was to use a GET .fetch() request on a public API. For the project we decided to use the Poké API (https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). This API did not require an Authentication Key and had a significant amount of End Points to pursue.

We chose the Poké API as a fun homage to our childhood hobbies. 

The webpage was built from the ground up using HMTL, JavaScript and CSS.
